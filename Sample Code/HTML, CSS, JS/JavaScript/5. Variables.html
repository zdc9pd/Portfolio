	/*
		JavaScript is an untyped language.
		That means that there are no type declarations; you don't need to specify whether a variable is a string, double, integer, etc.
	*/
	
	// To declare a variable, use the keyword "var"
	var number;
	// You can assign it any value
	number = 0;
	
	// Declaration + Assignment
	var number2 = 0;
	
	// Real Numbers
	var number3 = 3.14;
	
	// Booleans
	var tOrF = true;
	tOrF = false;
	
	// Strings
	var myString = "Hello World";
	var myString2 = 'hello again';
	
	// Objects (like Math and Date)
	var x = Math.PI;

	// Object Methods
	var y = Math.round(3.4);
	
	// We can log variables to the console to check their values
	console.log(y);
	
	
	
	// Arrays
	var myArray = new Array();
	// [] is an array literal; it's the same as the myArray declaration above.
	var myArray2 = [];
	
	// You can add elements to an array like this:
	myArray2[0] = 1;
	myArray2[1] = 2;
	
	// Or this:
	myArray2.push(3);
	
	// We can add all kinds of data types. Mixing works!
	myArray2[3] = "four";
	
	// console.dir allows us to inspect the contents of myArray2 as a tree structure
	console.dir(myArray2);
	
	
	
	// We can define a function like below. This is called a function declaration:
	/*
	function pageLoaded() {
		alert("The page has loaded!");
	}
	*/
	
	// Or functions can be treated like variables. This is called a function expression:
	var pageLoaded = function() {
		alert("The page has loaded!!!");
	}
	// Both functions are identical. Also, note that a function without a name (like the one assigned to 'pageLoaded' in the function expression above) is called an anonymous function.
	
	// In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens. That means you can store them in variables, pass them into other functions as arguments, organize them into arrays, store them in objects, etc.
	// Here I pass 'pageLoaded' to a new var called 'pageReallyDidInFactLoad'
	var pageReallyDidInFactLoad = pageLoaded;
